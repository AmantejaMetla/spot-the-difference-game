    cd spot-the-difference-game

    Open the Game:

        Background music will play, and sounds will trigger on correct/incorrect clicks.

How the Game Uses the JSON File

The game relies on a JSON file (config.json) to manage image paths and coordinates of the differences. Hereâ€™s the structure:
JSON File Overview

{
    "images": {
        "image1": "assets/Animals_Picture_original.png",
        "image2": "assets/Animals_Picture_with_Difference.png"
    },
    "differences": [
        { "x": 230, "y": 170, "radius": 25 },
        { "x": 400, "y": 320, "radius": 25 },
        ...
    ]
}

How It Works:

    Images:
        The images section specifies the file paths for the two images displayed in the game.

    Differences:
        The differences array stores the coordinates (x, y) and detection radius for each difference.
        When the player clicks on the images, the game checks if the click position matches any coordinates within the radius.

    Dynamic Setup:
        The game dynamically loads the JSON data when the page runs.
        This allows for easy modification of images or difference positions without changing the code.
